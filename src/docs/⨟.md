    r1 ⨟ r2
    r2 ∘ r1

The operator `⨟` (`\bbsemi`) sequences reagents. The composition `r1 ⨟ r2` means
to invoke `r1` and also `r2` with the output of `r1`. Note that the entire
reaction is still done atomically.

The syntaxes `r1 ⨟ r2` and `r2 ∘ r1` are equivalent. It is recommended to use
`r1 ⨟ r2` to clarify the top-to-down data flow when the reagent definition spans
multiple lines. However, knowing that `r1 ⨟ r2` is equivalent to `r2 ∘ r1`  can
be useful for remember that, in the reaction `(r2 ∘ r1)(x)`, the reagent `r1` is
the one that sees the input `x`.

# Example

```julia
julia> using Reagents

julia> ref = Reagents.Ref(111);

julia> r1 = Reagents.Read(ref);

julia> r2 = Reagents.Map(string);

julia> (r1 ⨟ r2)()
"111"
```
