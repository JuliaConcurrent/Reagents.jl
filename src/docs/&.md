    r1 & r2

The pairing combinator. Both reagents `r1` and `r2` are executed and the
downstream reagent receives the tuple `(y1, y2)` where `y1` is the output of
`r1` and `y2` is the output of `r2`.

# Example

```julia
julia> using Reagents

julia> ref1 = Reagents.Ref(111);

julia> ref2 = Reagents.Ref(222);

julia> r1 = Reagents.Read(ref1);

julia> r2 = Reagents.Read(ref2);

julia> (r1 & r2)()
(111, 222)
```
